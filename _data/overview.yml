    I'm Pavel, a Data Expert specializing in ELT, Data Warehousing, and Business Intelligence.
    With 5+ years of hands-on experience in Analytics, Reporting and Data Engineering across fintech, e-commerce, and energy domains, I build robust data solutions that drive business insights.
    I'm a proponent of Activity Schema and Schema-less data storage models, and I believe in the synergistic use of dbt and git to reduce time-to-data, including rapid prototyping and testing of data marts.
